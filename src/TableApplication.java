// Hansel just finished building his new wardrobe. After a short break, he decides itâ€™s time to build the table he bought for the TV. Just like the last time, he reads the instructions and follows the steps in the right order.
//   . Develop the code that builds the tv-table in different steps adding its parts one by one (like in the exercise 6) following the instructions below:
//   . Reuse the classes and interfaces from exercise 6 that you consider necessary.
//   . You need at least the following classes: TvTable, TvTableBuilder.
//   . The table needs the following parts to be finished: four legs, one shelf and one top.
//   . Create the TvTableBuilderTest that ensures that the tables are being built correctly.

public class TableApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Wardrobe wardrobe = new Wardrobe();
        TvTableBuilder tvTableBuilder = new TvTableBuilder();
        System.out.println(tvTableBuilder.build(wardrobe));
    }
}
// i'm really appreciate of this exercise. Because it gives me the feeling that if i understand something i can do it.
// Although i spent half a day to solve this question but i could reuse my learning here and save time.
// Btw i could not ruse those classes from Ikea application here because i deleted them after putting them on my Github.
//Also i could not do the testing part. Because me and some more guys missed that part, since there many exercises left
// to finish and hadn't enough time to review those lectures.
